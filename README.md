# Image Recoloring with K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This Python project applies the k-means clustering algorithm to recolor images with a limited palette of k colors. It demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness on three different images, exploring the impact of varying k values from 3 to 10.

## Key Features
- Application of k-means clustering for image recoloring.
- Exploration of the effects of different k values on image aesthetics.
- Analysis includes three distinct images to showcase the versatility of the approach.

## Results
For each image, the project presents the recolored versions for each k value, providing insights into the optimal k for image recoloring.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis, run the provided Python script with your chosen images and desired range of k values.
